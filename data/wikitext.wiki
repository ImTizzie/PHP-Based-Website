= Line breaks (and paragraphs) =

A single newline here
has no effect on the layout.

But an empty line starts a new paragraph, 
or ends a list or an indented part.

= Indent text (note: no Outdent needed) =

Indentation as used on talk pages:

:Each colon at the start of a line
::causes the line to be indented by three more character positions.
:::(The indentation persists
so long as no carriage return or line break is used.)
:::Repeat the indentation at any line break.
::::Use an extra colon for each response.
:::::And so forth ...
::::::And so on ...

= Italics and bold =

To ''italicize text'', put two consecutive apostrophes on each side of it.

Three apostrophes each side will '''bold the text'''.

Five consecutive apostrophes on each side (two for italics plus three for bold) produces '''''bold italics'''''.
